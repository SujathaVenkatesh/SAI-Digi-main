Although other search engines also have marketing tools, we focus mainly on Google. Thatâ€™s because it is the most widely used search engine worldwide and, if you are a small or medium-sized company, it would be better to consolidate your marketing budget in a large campaign instead to dilute it in a few that do not obtain significant results. Google Ads control all marketing spaces on Google, so it also includes YouTube along with the search results page of your search engine.</p>
