                        SEO is the practice of improving and promoting a website to increase the number of visitors the site receives from search engines. There are many aspects to SEO, from the words on your page to the way other sites link to you on the web. In fact, a majority of SEO is done through syndicated content. This is an effective way of adding greater depth and immediacy of information to your web pages, making them more attractive to users.
